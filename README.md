# ND1309 C2 Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps - Project Submission


### Overview

This is my submission for the StarNotary service for the Blockchain developer program. There are a few discrepancies from the project instructions. I have done a number of Udacity projects now and I have consistently found it best to use the latest versions of all the tools. So, instead of using the older versions of all the dependencies, I have used all the latest versions and updated my contract code to be compliant with them. I have included the latest versions below.

The other design change I made was to use the Ropsten test network instead of the Rinkeby. The Rinkeby network faucets require a social network login which I was unwilling to provide. The configuration for Ropsten is included along with the links for the contract address. 

**Security Note:**

  I have included the mnemonic for my test Metamask wallet in notes of my submission. Project reviewers will have to create their own .env file and copy and paste these values into the file.
